Dream company choose this project because: “We have excellent skills to extract sex from visual assessment of human faces, but assessing sex from human brain rhythms seems impossible.” \n",

    "“For several decades, traditional machine learning techniques have been frequently applied to brain imaging data, including electroencephalography (EEG), with applications ranging from characterization of the EEG background pattern or quantification of focal or global ischaemia to detection of epileptiform discharges and diagnostics in depression. Common to most of these techniques is the requirement for prior assumptions to guide extraction of particular features to be used for classification. Examples include spectral features or correlations between EEG signals from different brain regions. A limitation of these approaches is that unknown and potentially relevant features may not be included. Deep nets do not need prior extraction of such hand-made features, can learn from raw data, and have potential to detect subtle differences in otherwise similar patterns.” https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21495-7\n",
